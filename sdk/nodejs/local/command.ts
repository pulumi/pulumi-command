/**
 * A local command to be executed.
 *
 * This command can be inserted into the life cycles of other resources using the `dependsOn` or `parent` resource options. A command is considered to have failed when it finished with a non-zero exit code. This will fail the CRUD step of the `Command` resource.
 *
 * ## Example Usage
 *
 * ### Basic Example
 *
 * This example shows the simplest use case, simply running a command on `create` in the Pulumi lifecycle.
 *
 * ```typescript
 * import { local } from "@pulumi/command";
 *
 * const random = new local.Command("random", {
 *     create: "openssl rand -hex 16",
 * });
 *
 * export const output = random.stdout;
 * ```
 *
 * ### Invoking a Lambda during Pulumi Deployment
 *
 * This example show using a local command to invoke an AWS Lambda once it's deployed. The Lambda invocation could also depend on other resources.
 *
 * ```typescript
 * import * as aws from "@pulumi/aws";
 * import { local } from "@pulumi/command";
 * import { getStack } from "@pulumi/pulumi";
 *
 * const f = new aws.lambda.CallbackFunction("f", {
 *     publish: true,
 *     callback: async (ev: any) => {
 *         return `Stack ${ev.stackName} is deployed!`;
 *     }
 * });
 *
 * const invoke = new local.Command("execf", {
 *     create: `aws lambda invoke --function-name "$FN" --payload '{"stackName": "${getStack()}"}' --cli-binary-format raw-in-base64-out out.txt >/dev/null && cat out.txt | tr -d '"'  && rm out.txt`,
 *     environment: {
 *         FN: f.qualifiedArn,
 *         AWS_REGION: aws.config.region!,
 *         AWS_PAGER: "",
 *     },
 * }, { dependsOn: f })
 *
 * export const output = invoke.stdout;
 * ```
 *
 * ### Using Triggers
 *
 * This example defines several trigger values of various kinds. Changes to any of them will cause `cmd` to be re-run.
 *
 * ```typescript
 * import * as pulumi from "@pulumi/pulumi";
 * import * as command from "@pulumi/command";
 * import * as random from "@pulumi/random";
 *
 * const str = "foo";
 * const fileAsset = new pulumi.asset.FileAsset("Pulumi.yaml");
 * const rand = new random.RandomString("rand", {length: 5});
 * const localFile = new command.local.Command("localFile", {
 *     create: "touch foo.txt",
 *     archivePaths: ["*.txt"],
 * });
 *
 * const cmd = new command.local.Command("cmd", {
 *     create: "echo create > op.txt",
 *     delete: "echo delete >> op.txt",
 *     triggers: [
 *         str,
 *         rand.result,
 *         fileAsset,
 *         localFile.archive,
 *     ],
 * });
 * ```
